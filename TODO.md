# AI Assistant - Feature Roadmap


## High Priority

1. **UI Automation for Computer Control:** Integrate UI automation capabilities into `computer_control` to scan and identify UI elements reliably. This will improve the accuracy and robustness of desktop interactions.
2. **Event Reminder Tool:** Develop a dedicated event reminder tool that integrates with the calendar API.
3. **Enhanced Wait Tool:** Improve the `wait` tool to be more intelligent and adaptable, potentially incorporating checks for specific UI elements or conditions.

## Medium Priority

4. **Long-Term Memory/Context:** Implement a persistent memory system (e.g., Vector Database or similar) to retain conversation history and user preferences. This will enable more personalized and efficient assistance.

5. **Improved Reasoning & Planning:** Enhance reasoning capabilities to break down complex tasks into manageable steps and anticipate potential issues. This is crucial for handling multi-step requests.
6. **Control a ROBOTIC ARM:** YES control a Robotic arm 

## Low Priority

7. **Cloud Deployment & Cross-Device Synchronization:** Deploy the AI assistant to a cloud-based infrastructure to enable access and synchronization across multiple devices, including voice interaction capabilities. This will allow users to interact with the assistant from anywhere.
& Planning:** Enhance reasoning capabilities to break down complex tasks into manageable steps and anticipate potential issues. This is crucial for handling multi-step requests.
